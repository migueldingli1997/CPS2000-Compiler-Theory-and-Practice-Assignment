# CPS2000 (Compiler Theory and Practice) Assignment

In the [solution folder](https://github.com/migueldingli1997/CPS2000-Compiler-Theory-and-Practice-Assignment/tree/master/Implementation/Project), use the ``Compile.sh`` bash script or ``CMakeLists.txt`` to compile two versions of the program.

If ``Compile.sh`` is used, then:

 - Use ``Run1.sh`` to run the non-R.E.P.L mode of the program. By default, this will use the file test/File1.prog and output the XML to xmlOutput/out.xml
 - Use ``Run2.sh`` to run the R.E.P.L mode of the program.

If ``CmakeLists.txt`` is used, then:

 - Note that for ``main1.cpp``, the source file and xml output file have to be specified. In ``Run1.sh`` (in the case of ``Compile.sh``), these were the files "test/File1.prog" and "xmlOutput/out.xml".
